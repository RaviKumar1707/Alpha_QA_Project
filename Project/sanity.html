                <h1>SANITY TESTING</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Sanity testing is a kind of Software Testing performed after receiving a software build, with minor changes in code, or functionality, to ascertain that the bugs have been fixed and no further issues are introduced due to these changes. The goal is to determine that the proposed functionality works roughly as expected. If sanity test fails, the build is rejected to save the time and costs involved in a more rigorous testing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The objective is “not” to verify thoroughly the new functionality but to determine that the developer has applied some rationality (sanity) while producing the software. For instance, if your scientific calculator gives the result of 2 + 2 =5! Then, there is no point testing the advanced functionalities like sin 30 + cos 50.</p>
            <h2>Keynotes on Sanity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sanity Testing is done to check the new functionality/bugs have been fixed</li>
                <li>The objective of the testing is to verify the “rationality” of the system in order to proceed with more rigorous testing</li>
                <li>Sanity testing in software testing is usually performed by testers</li>
                <li>Sanity testing is usually not documented and is unscripted</li>
                <li>Sanity testing is a subset of Regression Testing</li>
                <li>Sanity testing exercises only the particular component of the entire system</li>
                <li>Sanity Testing is like specialized health check up</li>
