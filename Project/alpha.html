                <h1>ALPHA TESTING</h1>
            </div>
            <p><b>Alpha Testing</b> is a type of software testing performed to identify bugs before releasing the software product to the real users or public. It is a type of <a href="acceptance.html">acceptance testing</a>. The main objective of alpha testing is to refine the software product by finding and fixing the bugs that were not discovered through previous tests.</p>
            <p>Alpha testing is typically performed by in-house software engineers or QA staff. It is the final testing stage before the software is released into the real world.</p>
            <h2>Who is involved in Alpha testing?</h2>
            <p>Alpha testing has two phases,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first phase of testing is done by in-house developers. They either use hardware-assisted debuggers or debugger software. The aim to catch bugs quickly. Usually while alpha testing, a tester will come across to plenty of bugs, crashes, missing features, and docs.</li>
                <li>While the second phase of alpha testing is done by software QA staff, for additional testing in an environment. It involves both black box and White Box Testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, alpha testing can be envisioned as an online application that is not completely ready for the usage but has been opened up to get some initial feedback.</p>
            <h2>How to do Alpha Testing</h2>
            <p>To do <b>Alpha Testing</b> efficiently for software testing, we need to first review the design specification and functional requirements, then develop a comprehensive test plan and test cases, after that execute the test plan in order to find log defects and fix those defects and finally retest once the issues are solved for smooth functioning of software.</p>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides better view about the reliability of the software at an early stage</li>
                <li>Helps simulate real time user behavior and environment.</li>
                <li>Detect many showstopper or serious errors</li>
                <li>Ability to provide early detection of errors with respect to design and functionality</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In depth, functionality cannot be tested as software is still under development stage Sometimes developers and testers are dissatisfied with the results of alpha testing</li>
            </ul>
