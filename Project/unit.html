                <h1>UNIT TESTING</h1>
            </div>
            <p><b>Unit Testing</b> is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.</p>
            <h2>Unit Testing Techniques:</h2>
            <p>The Unit Testing Techniques are mainly categorized into three parts which are Black box testing that involves testing of user interface along with input and output, White box testing that involves testing the functional behaviour of the software application and Gray box testing that is used to execute test suites, test methods, test cases and performing risk analysis.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Code coverage techniques used in Unit Testing are listed below:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Statement Coverage</li>
                <li>Decision Coverage</li>
                <li>Branch Coverage</li>
                <li>Condition Coverage</li>
                <li>Finite State Machine Coverage</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Unit Testing Advantage:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Developers looking to learn what functionality is provided by a unit and how to use it can look at the unit tests to gain a basic understanding of the unit API.</li>
                <li>Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly (i.e. Regression testing). The procedure is to write test cases for all functions and methods so that whenever a change causes a fault, it can be quickly identified and fixed.</li>
                <li>Due to the modular nature of the unit testing, we can test parts of the project without waiting for others to be completed.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Unit Testing Disadvantage:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Unit testing can not be expected to catch every error in a program.</li>
                <li>It is not possible to evaluate all execution paths even in the most trivial programs.</li>
                <li>Unit testing by its very nature focuses on a unit of code. Hence it can not catch integration errors or broad system level errors.</li>
            </ul>
