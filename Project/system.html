            <p><b>System Testing</b> is a level of testing that validates the complete and fully integrated software product. The purpose of a system test is to evaluate the end-to-end system specifications. Usually, the software is only one element of a larger computer-based system. Ultimately, the software is interfaced with other software/hardware systems. System Testing is defined as a series of different tests whose sole purpose is to exercise the full computer-based system.</p>
            <h2>Types of System Testing</h2>
            <p>There are more than 50 types of System Testing. Below we have listed types of system testing a large software development company would typically use</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Usability Testing</b>: mainly focuses on the user's ease to use the application, flexibility in handling controls and ability of the system to meet its objectives</li>
                <li><b>Load Testing</b>: is necessary to know that a software solution will perform under real-life loads.</li>
                <li><a href="regression.html">Regression Testing</a>:involves testing done to make sure none of the changes made over the course of the development process have caused new bugs. It also makes sure no old bugs appear from the addition of new software modules over time.</li>
                <li><b>Recovery Testing</b>: is done to demonstrate a software solution is reliable, trustworthy and can successfully recoup from possible crashes.</li>
                <li><b>Migration Testing</b>: is done to ensure that the software can be moved from older system infrastructures to current system infrastructures without any issues.</li>
                <li><b>Functional Testing</b>: Also known as functional completeness testing, Functional Testing involves trying to think of any possible missing functions. Testers might make a list of additional functionalities that a product could have to improve it during functional testing.</li>
                <li><b>Hardware/Software Testing</b>: IBM refers to Hardware/Software testing as <b>HW/SW Testing</b>. This is when the tester focuses his/her attention on the interactions between the hardware and software during system testing.</li>
            </ul>
