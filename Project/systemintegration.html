            <p>System <a href="integration.html">Integration Testing</a> is defined as a type of software testing carried out in an integrated hardware and software environment to verify the behavior of the complete system. It is testing conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system’s compliance with its specified requirement.</p>
            <br>
            <p>System Integration Testing (SIT) is performed to verify the interactions between the modules of a software system. It deals with the verification of the high and low-level software requirements specified in the Software Requirements Specification/Data and the Software Design Document. It also verifies a software system’s coexistence with others and tests the interface between modules of the software application. In this type of testing, modules are first tested individually and then combined to make a system. For Example, software and/or hardware components are combined and tested progressively until the entire system has been integrated.</p>

            <h2>Why do System Integration Testing?</h2>
            <p>In Software Engineering, System Integration Testing is done because,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It helps to detect Defect early</li>
                <li>Earlier feedback on the acceptability of the individual module will be available</li>
                <li>Scheduling of Defect fixes is flexible, and it can be overlapped with development</li>
                <li>Correct data flow</li>
                <li>Correct control flow</li>
                <li>Correct timing</li>
                <li>Correct memory usage</li>
                <li>Correct with software requirements</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to do System Integration Testing</h2>
            <p>It’s a systematic technique for constructing the program structure while conducting tests to uncover errors associated with interfacing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All modules are integrated in advance, and the entire program is tested as a whole. But during this process, a set of errors is likely to be encountered.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Correction of such errors is difficult because isolation causes is complicated by the vast expansion of the entire program. Once these errors are rectified and corrected, a new one will appear, and the process continues seamlessly in an endless loop. To avoid this situation, another approach is used, Incremental Integration. We will see more detail about an incremental approach later in the tutorial.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are some incremental methods like the integration tests are conducted on a system based on the target processor. The methodology used is Black Box Testing. Either bottom-up or top-down integration can be used.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Test cases are defined using the high-level software requirements only.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Software integration may also be achieved largely in the host environment, with units specific to the target environment continuing to be simulated in the host. Repeating tests in the target environment for confirmation will again be necessary.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Confirmation tests at this level will identify environment-specific problems, such as errors in memory allocation and de-allocation. The practicality of conducting software integration in the host environment will depend on how much target specific functionality is there. For some embedded systems the coupling with the target environment will be very strong, making it impractical to conduct software integration in the host environment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Large software developments will divide software integration into a number of levels. The lower levels of software integration could be based predominantly in the host environment,with later levels of software integration becoming more dependent on the target environment.</p>
