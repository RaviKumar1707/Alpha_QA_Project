                <h1>BETA TESTING</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Beta Testing is performed by “real users” of the software application in “real environment” and it can be considered as a form of external <a href="useracceptance.html">User Acceptance Testing</a>. It is the final test before shipping a product to the customers. Direct feedback from customers is a major advantage of Beta Testing. This testing helps to test products in customer’s environment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Beta version of the software is released to a limited number of end-users of the product to obtain feedback on the product quality. Beta testing reduces product failure risks and provides increased quality of the product through customer validation.</p>
            <h2>Types of Beta Testing</h2>
            <p>There are different types of Beta tests in software testing, and they are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traditional Beta Testing: Product is distributed to the target market, and related data is gathered in all aspects. This data can be used for Product improvement.</li>
                <li>Public Beta Testing: Product is publicly released to the outside world via online channels and data can be gathered from anyone. Based on feedback, product improvements can be done. For example, Microsoft conducted the largest of all Beta Tests for its OS — Windows 8 before officially releasing it.</li>
                <li>Technical Beta Testing: Product is released to the internal group of an organization and gathers feedback/data from the employees of the organization. </li>
                <li>Focused Beta: Product is released to the market for gathering feedback on specific features of the program. For example, important functionality of the software.</li>
                <li>Post-release Beta: Product is released to the market and data is gathered to make improvements for the future release of the product.</li>
                <h2>Phases of Testing</h2>
                <p>Alpha and Beta tests are typically carried for “off-the-shelf” software or product-oriented companies. The Phases of Testing for a product company typically varies from a service-oriented organization. Following is the testing phase adopted by product firms</p>
                <img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/TestingPhase.png">
                <p>Pre-Alpha:- Software is a prototype. UI is complete. But not all features are completed. At this stage, software is not published.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Alpha: Software is near its development and is internally tested for bugs/issues</p>
                <br>
                <p>Beta: Software is stable and is released to a limited user base. The goal is to get customer feedback on the product and make changes in software accordingly</p>
                <br>
                <p>Release Candidate (RC): Based on the feedback of Beta Test, you make changes to the software and want to test out the bug fixes. At this stage, you do not want to make radical changes in functionality but just check for bugs. RC is also put out to the public</p>
                <br>
                <p>Release: All works, software is released to the public.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduces product failure risk via customer validation.</li>
                <li>Beta Testing allows a company to test post-launch infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Improves product quality via customer feedback</li>
                <li>Cost effective compared to similar data gathering methods</li>
                <li>Creates goodwill with customers and increases customer satisfaction</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantage</h3>
            <li>Test Management is an issue. As compared to other testing types which are usually executed inside a company in a controlled environment, beta testing is executed out in the real world where you seldom have control.</li>
            <li>Finding the right beta users and maintaining their participation could be a challeng.</li>
