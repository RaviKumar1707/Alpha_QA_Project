                <h1>COMPATIBILITY TESTING</h1>
            </div>
            <h2>What is Compatibility?</h2>
            <p>Compatibility is nothing but the capability of existing or living together. In normal life, Oil is not compatible with water, but milk can be easily combined with water.</p>
            <h2>What is Compatibility Testing?</h2>
            <p>Compatibility Testing is a type of Software testing to check whether your software is capable of running on different hardware, operating systems, applications, network environments or Mobile devices.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Compatibility Testing is a type of Non-functional testing</p>
            <h2>Types of Compatibility Tests</h2>
            <img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/c2.png">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hardware:</b> It checks software to be compatible with different hardware configurations.</li>
                <li><b>Operating Systems:</b> It checks your software to be compatible with different Operating Systems like Windows, Unix, Mac OS etc.</li>
                <li><b>Software:</b> It checks your developed software to be compatible with other software. For example, MS Word application should be compatible with other software like MS Outlook, MS Excel, VBA etc.</li>
                <li><b>Network:</b> Evaluation of performance of a system in a network with varying parameters such as Bandwidth, Operating speed, Capacity. It also checks application in different networks with all parameters mentioned earlier.</li>
                <li><b>Browser:</b> It checks the compatibility of your website with different browsers like Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer etc.</li>
                <li><b>Devices:</b> It checks compatibility of your software with different devices like USB port Devices, Printers and Scanners, Other media devices and Blue tooth.</li>
                <li><b>Mobile:</b> Checking your software is compatible with mobile platforms like Android, iOS etc.</li>
                <li><b>Versions of the software:</b> It is verifying your software application to be compatible with different versions of the software. For instance checking your Microsoft Word to be compatible with Windows 7, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 7 SP2, Windows 7 SP3.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are two types of version checking in Compatibility Testing :</p>

            <h3>Backward Compatibility Testing</h3>
            <p><b>Backward Compatibility Testing</b> is a technique to verify the behavior and compatibility of the developed hardware or software with their older versions of the hardware or software. Backward compatibility testing is much predictable as all the changes from the previous versions are known.</p>
            <h3>Forward Compatibility Testing</h3>
            <p><b>Forward Compatibility Testing</b> is a process to verify the behavior and compatibility of the developed hardware or software with the newer versions of the hardware or software. Forward compatibility testing is a bit hard to predict as the changes that will be made in the newer versions are not known.</p>
